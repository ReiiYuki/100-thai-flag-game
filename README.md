Go High Thai National Flag! or ชักให้สูง ธงชาติไทย! is flag raising simulation game. We also apply knowledge about height of artifact in this game.

## Objective

![100yr.png](Assets\Sprites\100-yr.jpg)

We work on this project for celebrating 100th anniversary Thai National Flag. (28th September 2017) This project is requested by Thai National Flag Museum who want this game to be a part of history.

## Process

We work with mix methodology of agile and unified process. We check our work day by day and set new goal every week. But some task is long term goal but inside the frame of an iteration. Taskworld is used in this project for planning and check done task.

## Idea

Just raising the flag is sounded too boring. So we decide to spawn some landmark in the background which the top of each of them match to the real high of it but different scale to the real world. Moreover we apply obstacle to make player get more fun experience.

Controlling system of this game use two buttons or fingers for playing, because we apply the idea that when people raise a flag they use two hands.

## Artwork Concept

We use pixel art because sometime people see pixel art and they can't really get what it is? So they have to imagine.

## Backend Service

We use backend service for storing the highscore of player. Our backend service is running in Amazon Web Service EC2 with Node.js and RethinkDB. You can visit our API Service in [this repository](https://github.com/PNNutkung/100-thai-flag-game-api).
